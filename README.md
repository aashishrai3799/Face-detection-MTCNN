# Face-detection-MTCNN
Detect Faces in images and live webcam feed

## Introduction
MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) is an algorithm consisting of 3 stages, which detects the bounding boxes of faces in an image along with their 5 Point Face Landmarks. Each stage gradually improves the detection results by passing itâ€™s inputs through a CNN, which returns candidate bounding boxes with their scores, followed by non max suppression.


## Working
This is an implementation of MTCNN. MTCNN gives 5 keypoints in a face, using those 5 keypoints, this code generates 4 more keypoints. It can detect multiple faces in an image or in live webcam feed.
